# Hello!

Welcome to the repository holding the application I made for my application to Karta. My name is Rylan, and I'm applying to become a front-end developer. Here you'll find a walkthrough for running the code on your device.


## Step 1: Check prerequisites

Make sure you are able to install dependencies using `npm install` and that you have Node.js installed. You should also be running the code while you're in the `karta-react-app` folder.

Node.js [16.14.2 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## Step 2: Install dependencies

### `npm install`

Running this will automatically download all dependencies listed in `package.json`. A full list of additional dependencies is included later in this document.

### Specifically for nodemon, run `npm install -g nodemon`


## Step 3: Run the application

### `npm run dev`

This will run both the React app and `server.js`! Normally I would separate the repositories, but for this simple application, I decided to pass out on that. IMPORTANT NOTE: The React app runs on `PORT:3000` while the server runs on `PORT:8000`. Please make sure these ports aren't in use while running this app.


## Voila

The app should be up and running! Please feel free to contact me through `rylanarguelles@gmail.com` if there are any issues.


## Additional dependencies

1. AntDesign
2. Axios
3. Body Parser
4. Concurrently
5. Cors
6. Express
